  - question: Why should I hire you?
    answer: Honestly, you could spend your funds on Ice Cream instead, but that won't
      help you get things done. That's why we're here. GTD.
  - question: Why do you cost so much?
    answer: |-
      We're real people with real limitations on time in our lifetimes.

      No time for tire-kickers or hrm'n & haw'n.
  - question: How can you possibly know so much?
    answer: "We pride ourselves on having spent a portion of our life experience as
      Generalists, hence we bring lots of breadth to the conversation.  \nAt the same
      time, deep dives into a myriad problems gives us expertise to make it hurt much
      less.  \nWe look at the big picture so you can focus on a few."
